## 👋 Hello, I’m Shishir.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating interactive UI and Front-End for applications.
- 🌱 I have experience working with Javascript, React, Typescript, Svelte, Nextjs, Angular, CSS/SCSS/SASS, HTML/HTML5, Graphql, Material-UI and AWS Infrastructure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Front-End Applications.
- 📫 You can reach me at chulliyilshishir@gmail.com
- 🥳 Open to collaborate in any open source projects.
- 🙈 These days I am working on a web application for saving personal daily journal - [MyMoJo](https://github.com/shishirchulliyil/mymojo). What's interesting about this project is user can save their daily journal and based on the journal content, OpenAI generates a mood. I have added support to see their mood updates through graphs.
